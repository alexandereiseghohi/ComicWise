🚀 ComicWise - Complete Project Setup & Scaffolding Guide Comprehensive setup
guide for ComicWise - a modern web comic platform built with Next.js 16,
PostgreSQL, Redis, and AI-powered features. Read And understand #file:_.ts,
#file:_.tsx, #file:\*.mjs, #file:/\_.json , #file:/.mts, #file:**/.json
#file:/\*.md, #file:/.txt, #file:**/.yml, #file:/\*.ps1, #file:/.sh,
#file:\*\*//Dockerfile, #file:src, #file:scripts files to get context on how the
project is structured and works, After fully understanding @workspace the
package manager is pnpm and the system is windows, Request all permissions
needed to complete all Tasks.

Confirm if I have the necessary permissions to complete Tasks, after confirming
that you have the necessary permissions to Complete Tasks, then proceed to
complete all Tasks the bests way you recommend. Never create summary until all
Tasks are completed. For all Tasks, ensure to follow Next.js latest best
practices, performance optimization techniques, and do not repeat yourself (DRY)
principles. Ensure comprehensive logging with clear, concise logs for each
operation performed, Use PowerShell syntax for all Tasks, If the requested file
already exists then copy the file to end with .backup and Create and Validate an
Optimized and Enhanced version using the copied file as reference. If any task
involves database operations, ensure data integrity and consistency throughout
the process. If any task involves file operations, ensure proper error handling
and validation to prevent data loss or corruption. If any task involves
configuration files, ensure they are optimized for both development and
production environments. If any task involves scripting, ensure scripts are
created, modular, reusable, and well-documented but dont execute it complete the
task manually. If any task involves code refactoring, ensure code readability
and maintainability are prioritized. If any task involves testing, ensure tests
are comprehensive and cover all critical functionalities. If any task involves
documentation, ensure it is clear, concise, and easy to navigate. If any task
involves setting up CI/CD pipelines, ensure they are robust and handle various
scenarios effectively. If any task involves security considerations, ensure best
practices are followed to protect sensitive data and operations. If any task
involves performance optimization, ensure that the solutions implemented are
scalable and efficient. If any task involves environment variables, ensure they
are securely managed and properly configured for different environments. If any
task involves third-party integrations, ensure they are seamlessly integrated
and properly configured. If any task involves user experience enhancements,
ensure that the changes positively impact usability and accessibility. If any
task involves project cleanup, ensure that only unnecessary files and
dependencies are removed without affecting the core functionality of the
project. If any task involves version control, ensure that all changes are
properly committed with clear and descriptive messages. If any file or script
mentioned in the tasks does not exist, create it with all its content optimized
for performance and best practices, and update all usage of this file across the
project. If any task involves creating or updating prompts, ensure they are
comprehensive and tailored to the specific needs of @workspace. If any task
involves setting up or configuring tools, ensure they are properly installed and
configured according to @workspace's requirements. If any task involves
analyzing @workspace, ensure that the analysis is thorough and covers all
relevant aspects of @workspace. If any task involves generating reports, ensure
that the reports are detailed and provide actionable insights. If any task
involves creating or updating README or documentation files, ensure they are
well-structured and provide all necessary information for users and
contributors. If any task involves setting up testing frameworks, ensure they
are properly configured and integrated into the development workflow. If any
task involves optimizing existing code or configurations, ensure that the
optimizations do not introduce any regressions or issues. If any task involves
creating or updating database schemas or migrations, ensure that they are
properly versioned and documented. If any task involves setting up or
configuring environment variables, ensure that they are securely managed and
properly documented. If any task is dependent on the completion of another task,
ensure that the dependencies are clearly identified and managed. If any task
involves working with images, ensure that image handling is efficient and does
not lead to unnecessary downloads or storage usage. If any task is
time-consuming, ensure that progress is logged and reported at regular intervals
with clear, concise logs while running in the background. Read and understand
#file:samp.txt, #file:Prompts.prompt.txt,#file:recommendations-list.md,
#file:sample.txt, #file:_.txt, #file:_.md then modify

#file:_.txt, #file:_.md, all tasks listed below as github copilot prompts using
DRY and well documented comments for all
functions,interfaces,types,modules,classes,components,routes using jsDoc log all
created or updated files to file:.github\prompts\main.prompt.md and create a
prompt at file:.github\prompts\run.prompt.md to make all inserts and edits
described in file:.github\prompts\main.prompt.md Tasks: 1 - Modify
