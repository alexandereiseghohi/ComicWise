🚀 ComicWise - Complete Project Setup & Scaffolding Guide
Comprehensive setup guide for ComicWise - a modern web comic platform built with Next.js 16, PostgreSQL, Redis, and AI-powered features.
Read And understand /*.ts, #file:/.tsx, #file:**/.mjs, #file:/*.json , #file:/.mts, #file:**/.json #file:/*.md, #file:/.txt, #file:**/.yml, #file:/*.ps1, #file:/.sh, #file:**//Dockerfile, #file:src, #file:scripts files to get context on how the project is structured and works, After fully understanding the project the package manager is pnpm and the system is windows, Request all permissions needed to complete all Tasks.

Confirm if I have the necessary permissions to complete Tasks, after confirming that you have the necessary permissions to Complete Tasks, then proceed to complete all Tasks the bests way you recommend.
Never create summary until all Tasks are completed.
For all Tasks, ensure to follow Next.js latest best practices, performance optimization techniques, and do not repeat yourself (DRY) principles. Ensure comprehensive logging with clear, concise logs for each operation performed,
Use PowerShell syntax for all Tasks,
If the requested file already exists then copy the file to end with .backup and Create and Validate an Optimized and Enhanced version using the copied file as reference.
If any task involves database operations, ensure data integrity and consistency throughout the process.
If any task involves file operations, ensure proper error handling and validation to prevent data loss or corruption.
If any task involves configuration files, ensure they are optimized for both development and production environments.
If any task involves scripting, ensure scripts are created, modular, reusable, and well-documented but dont execute it complete the task manually.
If any task involves code refactoring, ensure code readability and maintainability are prioritized.
If any task involves testing, ensure tests are comprehensive and cover all critical functionalities.
If any task involves documentation, ensure it is clear, concise, and easy to navigate.
If any task involves setting up CI/CD pipelines, ensure they are robust and handle various scenarios effectively.

If any task involves project cleanup, ensure that only unnecessary files and dependencies are removed without affecting the core functionality of the project.
If any task involves version control, ensure that all changes are properly committed with clear and descriptive messages.
If any file or script mentioned in the tasks does not exist, create it with all its content optimized for performance and best practices, and update all usage of this file across the project.
If any task involves creating or updating prompts, ensure they are comprehensive and tailored to the specific needs of the project.
If any task involves setting up or configuring tools, ensure they are properly installed and configured according to the project's requirements.
If any task involves analyzing the project, ensure that the analysis is thorough and covers all relevant aspects of the project.
If any task involves generating reports, ensure that the reports are detailed and provide actionable insights.
If any task involves creating or updating README or documentation files, ensure they are well-structured and provide all necessary information for users and contributors.
If any task involves setting up testing frameworks, ensure they are properly configured and integrated into the development workflow.
If any task involves optimizing existing code or configurations, ensure that the optimizations do not introduce any regressions or issues.
If any task involves creating or updating database schemas or migrations, ensure that they are properly versioned and documented.
If any task involves setting up or configuring environment variables, ensure that they are securely managed and properly documented.
If any task is dependent on the completion of another task, ensure that the dependencies are clearly identified and managed.
If any task involves working with images, ensure that image handling is efficient and does not lead to unnecessary downloads or storage usage.
If any task is time-consuming, ensure that progress is logged and reported at regular intervals with clear, concise logs while running in the background.
