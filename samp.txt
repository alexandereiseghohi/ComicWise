🚀 ComicWise - Complete Project Setup & Scaffolding Guide
Comprehensive setup guide for ComicWise - a modern web comic platform built with Next.js 16, PostgreSQL, Redis, and AI-powered features.
Read And understand /*.ts, @/.tsx, @**/.mjs, @/*.json , @/.mts, @**/.json @/*.md, @/.txt, @**/.yml, @/*.ps1, @/.sh, @**//Dockerfile, @src, @scripts files to get context on how the project is structured and works, After fully understanding the project the package manager is pnpm and the system is windows, Request all permissions needed to complete all Tasks.

Confirm if I have the necessary permissions to complete Tasks, after confirming that you have the necessary permissions to Complete Tasks, then proceed to complete all Tasks the bests way you recommend.
Never create summary until all Tasks are completed.
For all Tasks, ensure to follow Next.js latest best practices, performance optimization techniques, and do not repeat yourself (DRY) principles. Ensure comprehensive logging with clear, concise logs for each operation performed,
Use PowerShell syntax for all Tasks,
If the requested file already exists then copy the file to end with .backup and Create and Validate an Optimized and Enhanced version using the copied file as reference.
If any task involves database operations, ensure data integrity and consistency throughout the process.
If any task involves file operations, ensure proper error handling and validation to prevent data loss or corruption.
If any task involves configuration files, ensure they are optimized for both development and production environments.
If any task involves scripting, ensure scripts are created, modular, reusable, and well-documented but dont execute it complete the task manually.
