# Turbopack ignore file for server-side operations
# These files contain intentional dynamic file path operations that trigger
# Turbopack's overly broad pattern warnings. They are safe because:
# 1. They are server-side only operations
# 2. They are not bundled with client code
# 3. They are necessary for seed and upload functionality
