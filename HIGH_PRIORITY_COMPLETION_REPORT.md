# ComicWise - High Priority Tasks Completion Report

**Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Developer:** GitHub Copilot CLI

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

All high-priority tasks from the recommendations list have been successfully
completed. The ComicWise platform was found to have existing routes in the
`(root)` directory, so new components were integrated with the existing
structure. The platform now has fully functional user profile management,
chapter reading, and enhanced bookmark management.

**Note:** The project already had comprehensive comics listing and details pages
in `src/app/(root)/comics/`. New components were created to enhance this
existing system rather than duplicate it.
